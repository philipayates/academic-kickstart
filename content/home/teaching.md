# Custom widget.

# An example of using the custom widget to create your own homepage section.
# To create more sections, duplicate this file and edit the values below as desired.

# Note: a full width section format can be enabled by commenting out the `title` and `subtitle` with a `#`.
title = "Teaching"
subtitle = ""


# Order that this section will appear in.

# One way we could make this different is to present the places of teaching as a smaller list with a click through to course descriptions and why we were teaching at that location. More in line with the project presentation line of reasoning. If we did each teaching engagement independently like a talk, and then aggregate them, then we could use schema.org metadata to describe each teaching engagement.
